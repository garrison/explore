Sandstorm is a self-hostable web productivity suite. It's implemented as a security-hardened web app package manager. Sandstorm's goal is to make it easy to run your own server.

Use Sandstorm to install apps to create documents, spreadsheets,
blogs, git repositories, task lists, and more, just as as you would
install apps on your phone.

Sandstorm is open source and can be installed on any x86-64 Linux system.
