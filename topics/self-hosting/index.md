There are two distinct, commonly used definitions of self-hosting:

- A network service that is run on a server that is controlled by the
  user of that service.
- A computer program that can produce new versions of that same
  program (e.g., a compiler that can compile its own source code, or
  an operating system that can be used to compile itself).
